## **Project name: Dragon Hunt**
This is a text-based rpg/rogue-like whose ideas are loosely inspired by some of our favorite games within the genres.  
Dragon Hunt will be a short, turn-based combat game with story elements and character progression systems. Dragon  
Hunt is an old-school styled game meant to be played in the command line as there are no real visuals (yet). The  
premise is that the world has been thrown off balance by a corrupt king and you, the player, are sent to put a stop  
to the evil that has come over the continent.  
  
To play this game, download all of the files listed, store then in the same directory, and run 'DH_Main.py".
